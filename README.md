# Mod-2-VBA-challenge
## A VBA script written as part of a course assignemnt task which analyses generated stock market data with screenshots of all asked output

This project is my own script and screenshots of my results in response to a homework assignment given through the UWA data analytics bootcamp course. It includes calculations that loops through all the stocks for three years and outputs different values across all sheets. It uses conditonal formatting as a bonus task.

## How to install this example
The screenshots are self-explanatory and just respesent some of thes results not all.
The VBA script is exported as a basic file which can be read using any text editor like notepad or VS code. This can be run in excel using VBA to run the functions.
